## User Story
### AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
    
### Acceptance Criteria for Minimum Viable Product

GIVEN a social network API
*  WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
*  WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
*  WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
*  WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## Features
-  The API contains all of the standard CRUD endpoints for users, thoughts (with a tie to the user that created the thought), and reactions.
-  As with all social sites, there is also an endpoint for the user to create a "friends" list using the user ID of the user they would like to "friend".
